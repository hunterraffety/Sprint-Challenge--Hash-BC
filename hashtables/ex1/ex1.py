# Given a package with a weight limit limit and a list weights of item weights, implement a function get_indices_of_item_weights that finds two items whose sum of weights equals the weight limit limit. Your function will return an instance of an Answer tuple that has the following form:

# (zero, one)

# where each element represents the item weights of the two packages. The higher valued index should be placed in the zeroth index and the smaller index should be placed in the first index. If such a pair doesnâ€™t exist for the given inputs, your function should return None.

# NOTE: When calling hash_table_retrieve with a key that doesn't exist in the hash table, hash_table_retrieve will return None.

# Your solution should run in linear time.

# Example:

# input: weights = [ 4, 6, 10, 15, 16 ], length = 5, limit = 21
# output: [ 3, 1 ]  # since these are the indices of weights 15 and 6 whose sum equals 21
